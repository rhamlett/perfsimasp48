# Performance Problem Simulator

An educational Azure App Service application that **intentionally creates performance problems** for learning and demonstration purposes.

## 🎯 Purpose

This application is designed to help developers and DevOps engineers:

- **Learn** how to diagnose common performance issues in Azure App Service
- **Practice** using Azure monitoring and diagnostic tools
- **Demonstrate** performance anti-patterns in a controlled environment
- **Train** support teams on identifying and resolving performance problems

## ⚠️ Warning

**This application intentionally creates performance problems!**

- 🔥 **CPU stress** - Creates dedicated threads running spin loops to consume all CPU cores
- 📊 **Memory pressure** - Allocates and pins memory blocks to increase working set
- 🧵 **Thread pool starvation** - Uses sync-over-async anti-patterns to block thread pool threads
- 🐢 **Slow requests** - Generates long-running requests with sync-over-async patterns for CLR Profiler analysis
- 💥 **Application crashes** - Triggers fatal crashes for testing Azure Crash Monitoring and memory dumps
- ❌ **Failed requests** - Generates HTTP 5xx errors visible in AppLens and Application Insights

**Only deploy this application in isolated, non-production environments.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rhamlett/perfsimasp48.git
cd perfsimasp48

# Restore and build
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run --project src/PerfProblemSimulator

# Open in browser
# Dashboard: http://localhost:5000
# Swagger: http://localhost:5000/swagger
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

## 📊 Dashboard

The application includes a real-time dashboard at the root URL that shows:

- **CPU usage** - Current processor utilization
- **Memory** - Working set and GC heap sizes
- **Thread pool** - Active threads and queue length
- **Request latency** - Real-time probe response time (shows impact of thread pool starvation)
- **Active simulations** - Currently running problem simulations

The dashboard uses SignalR for real-time updates and includes controls to trigger each type of simulation.

### Metric Color Indicators

The CPU and Memory metric tiles use dynamic color coding based on utilization percentage:

| Color | Utilization | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Black (default) | 0-60% | Normal |
| Yellow | 60-80% | Warning - elevated usage |
| Red | >80% | Danger - potential resource exhaustion |

**Note:** Memory thresholds are calculated dynamically based on the actual total available memory reported by the server, ensuring accurate warnings regardless of the machine's RAM configuration.

## 🔌 API Endpoints

The slow request simulator generates requests using three different sync-over-async patterns:

**Query Parameters:**

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|

GET /api/loadtest?workIterations=10000&bufferSizeKb=2000

# Thread pool only (no CPU work)
GET /api/loadtest?workIterations=0&bufferSizeKb=100
```

**What it tests:**
- **CPU** - Sustained SHA256 cycles (~50% CPU per thread)
- **Memory** - Buffers held for entire request duration
- **Thread Pool** - Graceful degradation under concurrent load
- **Timeouts** - Random exceptions after 120s (20% probability)

## ⏱️ Request Latency Monitor

The dashboard includes a **Request Latency Monitor** that demonstrates how thread pool starvation affects real-world request processing.

### How It Works

- A dedicated background thread (not from the thread pool) continuously probes `/api/health/probe`
- Latency is measured end-to-end: request sent → response received
- Results are broadcast via SignalR to the dashboard in real-time

### What You'll Observe

| Scenario | Latency (Queue + Processing) | Status | Explanation |
|----------|------------------------------|--------|-------------|
| Normal operation | < 150ms | 🟢 Good | Thread pool threads available |
| Mild starvation | 150ms - 1s | 🟡 Degraded | Requests beginning to queue |
| Severe starvation | > 1s | 🔴 Severe | Significant queuing delay |
| Timeout | 30s | 🔴 Critical | No thread became available within timeout |

### Why This Matters

During thread pool starvation, CPU and memory metrics often look normal, but users experience severe latency. The latency monitor makes this invisible problem **visible** - you can watch response times spike from milliseconds to seconds when triggering the sync-over-async simulation.

## 🔧 Configuration

Configuration is managed through `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ProblemSimulator": {
    "MetricsCollectionIntervalMs": 250,
    "LatencyProbeIntervalMs": 200
  }
}
```

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `MetricsCollectionIntervalMs` | How often CPU/Memory/Thread metrics are collected | `250` |
| `LatencyProbeIntervalMs` | Server-side health probe interval (also configurable via `HEALTH_PROBE_RATE` env var) | `200` |

**Note:** This application is designed to be fully breakable for educational purposes. There are no safety limits on resource consumption — simulations can run until the application crashes or resources are exhausted.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured to customize application behavior. These are optional and primarily useful when deploying to Azure App Service.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HEALTH_PROBE_RATE` | Health probe interval in milliseconds. Controls how often the server sends latency probes through the Azure frontend. Minimum 100ms. | `200` |
| `IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` | Minutes of inactivity before suspending health probes. Reduces network traffic and Application Insights telemetry when idle. | `20` |
| `PAGE_FOOTER` | Custom HTML footer text displayed at the bottom of the dashboard. Supports HTML links for attribution. | (empty) |

#### HEALTH_PROBE_RATE

Controls the interval between server-side health probes. All probes are routed through the Azure frontend to capture realistic end-to-end latency including network hops.

- **Default:** 200ms (5 probes/sec)
- **Safety limit:** Minimum 100ms to prevent probe overlap
- **Use case:** Increase if CLR profiling shows probe requests overlapping; decrease for finer granularity

**Setting via Azure CLI:**
```bash
az webapp config appsettings set \
    --resource-group rg-perf-simulator \
    --name your-app-name \
    --settings HEALTH_PROBE_RATE=400
```

#### IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES

When the application is idle (no dashboard connections or load test requests), health probes are automatically suspended to reduce unnecessary network traffic to Azure's frontend, AppLens, and Application Insights.

- **Default:** 20 minutes
- **Wake-up:** Simply reload the dashboard or send any request
- **Activity sources:** Dashboard connections, load test requests

**Setting via Azure CLI:**
```bash
az webapp config appsettings set \
    --resource-group rg-perf-simulator \
    --name your-app-name \
    --settings IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=30
```

#### PAGE_FOOTER

The `PAGE_FOOTER` environment variable allows you to customize the footer credits displayed on the dashboard. This is useful for attributing tools, teams, or linking to relevant resources.

**Example Value:**
```
Created by <a href="https://speckit.org/" target="_blank">SpecKit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/copilot" target="_blank">Github Copilot</a>
```

**Setting via Azure CLI:**
```bash
az webapp config appsettings set \
    --resource-group rg-perf-simulator \
    --name your-app-name \
    --settings PAGE_FOOTER='Created by <a href="https://speckit.org/" target="_blank">SpecKit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/copilot" target="_blank">Github Copilot</a>'
```

**Setting Locally (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:PAGE_FOOTER = 'Created by <a href="https://speckit.org/" target="_blank">SpecKit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/copilot" target="_blank">Github Copilot</a>'
```

**Setting Locally (Bash):**
```bash
export PAGE_FOOTER='Created by <a href="https://speckit.org/" target="_blank">SpecKit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/copilot" target="_blank">Github Copilot</a>'
```

The footer is retrieved via the `/api/config/footer` endpoint and rendered in the dashboard's footer section. If `PAGE_FOOTER` is not set, the footer credits section is hidden.
