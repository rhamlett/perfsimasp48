# Feature Specification: Performance Problem Simulator

**Feature Branch**: `001-perf-problem-simulator`  
**Created**: 2026-01-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an Azure App Service test application that produces performance problems like high CPU, high memory usage, and sync over async thread blocking for demonstration, testing, and learning purposes"

## Overview

This application intentionally creates controllable performance problems commonly encountered in production Azure App Service environments. The purpose is educational: to provide a safe sandbox where developers, support engineers, and learners can:

1. **Observe** how different performance anti-patterns manifest in monitoring tools
2. **Practice** diagnosing issues using Azure diagnostics, Application Insights, and profiling tools
3. **Learn** to recognize symptoms and root causes of common performance problems

> ⚠️ **Important**: This application deliberately implements "bad" code patterns. It is intended **only** for demonstration, testing, and learning in non-production environments.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Trigger High CPU Usage (Priority: P1)

As a developer or support engineer, I want to trigger a controllable high-CPU condition so that I can observe how CPU saturation appears in Azure monitoring tools and practice diagnosing the root cause.

**Why this priority**: High CPU is the most common and visible performance problem. It affects all requests and is easily observable in Azure metrics, making it ideal for initial learning.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by invoking a single endpoint and observing CPU metrics spike in Azure Portal or local Task Manager. Delivers immediate, visible feedback for learners.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running and idle, **When** I invoke the high-CPU endpoint with a duration parameter, **Then** CPU usage rises to near 100% for the specified duration and returns to baseline afterward.

2. **Given** I have Azure Monitor or Application Insights configured, **When** I trigger high CPU for 60 seconds, **Then** the CPU spike is visible in the metrics dashboard within 2 minutes.

3. **Given** I invoke the high-CPU endpoint multiple times concurrently, **When** monitoring the application, **Then** each invocation contributes to sustained high CPU until all complete.

### User Story 2 - Trigger High Memory Usage (Priority: P2)

As a developer or support engineer, I want to trigger controllable memory pressure so that I can observe memory exhaustion patterns, understand garbage collection behavior, and practice diagnosing memory issues.

**Why this priority**: Memory problems are the second most common issue. They manifest differently than CPU issues and teach learners about managed memory, GC pressure, and potential out-of-memory conditions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by invoking the memory-pressure endpoint and observing memory metrics grow. The application should allow releasing the memory afterward to demonstrate recovery.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running with baseline memory usage, **When** I invoke the high-memory endpoint requesting allocation of a specific size, **Then** memory usage increases by approximately that amount.

2. **Given** I have allocated memory via the endpoint, **When** I invoke the release-memory endpoint, **Then** memory usage returns toward baseline (after GC runs).

3. **Given** I repeatedly allocate memory without releasing, **When** the process approaches its memory limit, **Then** the application remains responsive and reports the memory pressure condition rather than crashing unexpectedly.

---

### User Story 3 - Trigger Thread Pool Starvation via Sync-over-Async (Priority: P2)

As a developer or support engineer, I want to trigger thread pool starvation through sync-over-async blocking so that I can observe how this anti-pattern causes request queuing, timeouts, and apparent "hangs" even when CPU and memory appear normal.

**Why this priority**: Sync-over-async is a subtle but devastating problem. It's harder to diagnose than CPU/memory issues because traditional metrics look normal while the application becomes unresponsive. Understanding this pattern is critical for async programming mastery.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by invoking the sync-over-async endpoint repeatedly and observing increasing response times for unrelated endpoints, demonstrating thread pool exhaustion.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running normally, **When** I invoke the sync-over-async endpoint multiple times concurrently, **Then** response times for all endpoints increase as the thread pool becomes exhausted.

2. **Given** I am monitoring thread pool statistics, **When** I trigger sync-over-async blocking, **Then** I can observe thread pool queue depth increasing and available threads decreasing.

3. **Given** the thread pool is starved, **When** the blocking operations complete, **Then** the application recovers and response times return to normal.

---

### User Story 4 - View Application Health Dashboard (Priority: P3)

As a learner, I want a simple web dashboard showing the current state of the application (CPU, memory, thread pool status) so that I can observe the effects of my actions in real-time without requiring Azure Portal access.

**Why this priority**: While Azure monitoring is the primary learning target, a built-in dashboard provides immediate feedback and works for local development scenarios without Azure connectivity.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading the dashboard page and verifying it displays current metrics that update as conditions change.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running, **When** I navigate to the dashboard, **Then** I see current CPU percentage, memory usage, and thread pool statistics.

2. **Given** I trigger a high-CPU condition, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** the CPU metric reflects the elevated usage within 5 seconds.

3. **Given** I am viewing the dashboard, **When** I trigger any performance problem, **Then** the relevant metrics update to reflect the current state.

---

### User Story 5 - Generate Failed Requests for AppLens Analysis (Priority: P2)

As a developer or support engineer, I want to generate HTTP 5xx errors so that I can observe how failed requests appear in AppLens and Application Insights, and practice diagnosing application failures.

**Why this priority**: HTTP 500 errors are one of the most common issues investigated through Azure diagnostics. Understanding how failures appear in AppLens and Application Insights is essential for effective production troubleshooting.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by invoking the failed request endpoint and observing errors appear in AppLens (Azure Portal → Diagnose and Solve Problems) and the Application Insights Failures blade.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running normally, **When** I invoke the failed request endpoint with a count of 10, **Then** 10 HTTP 500 errors are generated and logged.

2. **Given** I am monitoring Application Insights, **When** I trigger failed requests, **Then** the errors appear in the Failures blade within 2-3 minutes with detailed exception information.

3. **Given** I am viewing the dashboard, **When** failed requests are generated, **Then** each failure appears in the Event Log with the specific exception type (e.g., NullReferenceException, TimeoutException) displayed in brown.

4. **Given** I have deployed to Azure App Service, **When** I generate failed requests, **Then** the errors are visible in AppLens diagnostics for incident analysis practice.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user requests more memory than available? The application should cap allocation at a safe maximum and report the limitation rather than crashing.
- What happens when duration parameters are extremely large? The application should enforce maximum duration limits to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
- How does the system handle concurrent triggering of different problem types? All problem simulators should operate independently without interfering with each other.
- What happens if the release-memory endpoint is called when no memory has been allocated? The operation should succeed gracefully with no effect.

- **SC-004**: Dashboard metrics refresh within 5 seconds of actual state changes
- **SC-005**: Application recovers to baseline performance within 60 seconds after stopping all problem simulations
- **SC-006**: All code implementing anti-patterns includes explanatory comments that a junior developer can understand
- **SC-007**: A learner with basic Azure knowledge can successfully trigger and observe each problem type within 15 minutes using the included documentation

## Assumptions

- The application will be deployed to Azure App Service for production demonstration, but will also run locally for development and learning
- Users have basic familiarity with web APIs and HTTP requests (e.g., can use a browser, curl, or Postman)
- Azure monitoring tools (Azure Monitor, Application Insights) are available but not required for basic functionality; Application Insights integration is optional via configuration and can be enabled through Azure Portal
- The target runtime is .NET (version to be determined in planning phase)
- Memory allocation limits are constrained by the App Service plan tier; documentation will note this dependency
