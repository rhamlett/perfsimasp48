### User Story Dependencies

| Story | Depends On | Can Start After |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| US1 (CPU) | Foundational only | Phase 2 complete |
| US2 (Memory) | Foundational only | Phase 2 complete |
| US3 (Thread) | Foundational only | Phase 2 complete |
| US4 (Dashboard) | Foundational only | Phase 2 complete |

**Note**: All user stories are independently implementable after Phase 2. They share foundational infrastructure but do not depend on each other.

### Within Each User Story

1. Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
2. Models before services
3. Interfaces before implementations
4. Services before controllers
5. Controller before logging integration

## Parallel Opportunities

### Phase 1 (Setup)

```
Parallel group: T004, T005, T006, T007 (all config files, no dependencies)
```

### Phase 2 (Foundational)

```
Parallel group: T008, T009, T010, T011 (all model files, no dependencies)
Parallel group: T016, T017 (unit tests, no dependencies)
```

### After Phase 2 Completes

```

```

### Within User Story 4

```
Parallel group: T047, T048, T049, T050, T051, T052 (all model files)
Parallel group: T044, T045 (tests before implementation)
```
