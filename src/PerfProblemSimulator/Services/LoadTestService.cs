 * LOAD TEST SERVICE IMPLEMENTATION - AI PORTABILITY DOCUMENTATION
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * This is the core implementation of the load test feature. It contains the
 * algorithm that simulates realistic application behavior under load.
 * 
 * ALGORITHM SUMMARY:
 * ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 * │ 1. INCREMENT concurrent counter (thread-safe)                          │
 * │ 2. START stopwatch                                                      │
 * │ 3. CALCULATE degradation delay:                                         │
 * │    delay = max(0, concurrent - softLimit) * degradationFactor           │
 * │ 4. APPLY delay (if any)                                                 │
 * │ 5. PERFORM CPU work (hash iterations)                                   │
 * │ 6. ALLOCATE memory buffer (released on method exit)                     │
 * │ 7. LOOP while processing:                                               │
 * │    - Check elapsed time                                                 │
 * │    - If > 120s: 20% chance to throw random exception                    │
 * │ 8. DECREMENT concurrent counter (in finally block - always runs)        │
 * │ 9. RETURN result with timing details                                    │
 * └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 * 
 * THREAD SAFETY:
 * Uses Interlocked methods for atomic counter operations. This is critical
 * because multiple requests execute concurrently.
 * 
 * PORTING TO OTHER LANGUAGES:
 * - PHP: Use APCu/Redis for shared state (PHP processes don't share memory)
 * - Node.js: Simple counter works (single-threaded), use atomic for workers
 * - Java: AtomicInteger, AtomicLong for counters
 * - Python: threading.Lock or asyncio.Lock, or multiprocessing.Value
 * 
 * DEPENDENCIES:
 * - Models/LoadTestRequest.cs - Input parameters
 * - Models/LoadTestResult.cs - Output format
 * - System.Diagnostics - For Stopwatch timing
 * - System.Threading - For Thread.SpinWait CPU work

     * THREAD-SAFE COUNTERS
     * =========================================================================
     * 
     * CONCEPT: Atomic Operations
     * When multiple threads modify a variable, we need "atomic" operations that
     * complete as a single unit. Without this, two threads might read the same
     * value and both increment to the same result, losing one increment.
     * 
     * C# IMPLEMENTATION:
     * - Interlocked.Increment: Atomically adds 1 and returns new value
     * - Interlocked.Decrement: Atomically subtracts 1 and returns new value
     * - Interlocked.Read: Atomically reads a 64-bit value
     * 
     * PORTING:
     * - PHP: APCu (apcu_inc/apcu_dec) or Redis (INCR/DECR) for cross-process
     * - Node.js: Standard increment works (single event loop)
     *            For worker threads: Atomics.add(sharedArray, index, 1)
     * - Java: AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger();
     *         counter.incrementAndGet(); counter.decrementAndGet();
     * - Python: threading.Lock() with manual increment, or atomic-counter package
     *           import threading
     *           lock = threading.Lock()
     *           with lock: counter += 1
